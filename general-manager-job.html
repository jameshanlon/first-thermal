      <p class="lead"> General Manager Vacancy</p>

      <p><b>Job Title / Position</b>: General Manager, First Thermal Ltd.
      approx. 27-month contract until end December 2023, with opportunity for
      extension. Probationary period 3 months.</p>

      <p><b>Reporting to</b>: MD/CEO</p>
      <p><b>Based</b>: Bristol</p>

      <p>If you would like a rewarding and stimulating job doing something you
      can be proud of, this is a unique opportunity to develop First Thermal
      Ltd. (FTL) a new social enterprise company, set up to be a social
      franchisor. FTL has been formed to build franchises that replicate the
      Bristol-based multiple-award-winning C.H.E.E.S.E. Project CIC, (TCP)
      which delivers thermal imaging Energy Tracing® surveys to reduce energy
      loss from homes - thus making warmer homes and a cooler planet. You will
      be joining a team of directors who have successfully developed the
      project over five years. </p>

      <p>This exciting and important environmental and social development is
      possible thanks to a grant from Energy for Tomorrow - a Centrica
      Initiative.</p>

      <h2>Your Role - developing the Franchise</h2>
      <p>To support the board of directors to develop and adapt the business
      model of TCP to become the profitable exemplar for the new FTL Franchise

      booking system, and unique equipment and training to create a streamlined
      efficient service, allowing franchisees to generate sustainable trading
      income.</p>

      <p>In the first 12-15 months you will oversee the recruitment of
      franchise pilots to test and adapt the business plan and franchise model,
      working with pilots to achieve a trading surplus and the highest possible
      quality franchise and customer experience, to enable expansion of the
      network nationwide from 2023. You will progressively take over the
      management from the MD/CEO, and on achieving financial stability by
      December 2023, there is an opportunity to continue and grow with the
      company.</p>
